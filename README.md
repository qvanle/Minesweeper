# MINESWEEPER
This is my first project, minesweeper.
I make this on Ubuntu 18.04, maybe something doesn't fit in window.
## How to install
you need to install makefile and SFML

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
after that you need open a terminal and go to the direct that you save this project.
run this command:
```
make GetGame
```
after that, if the game doesn't start or you want to play again, run file MyGame.out.
